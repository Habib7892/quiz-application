# quiz application

This is a simple quiz application developed using Java and JavaFX. MySQL is used as the database to store the application data.  

The **pom.xml** file includes all the necessary dependencies required to run the application.  

The database contains several tables, including those for quiz topics, users, and attempts, among others.

To participate in the quiz, the user must first register and then log in to the application. Once logged in, the user can access and take the quiz.
